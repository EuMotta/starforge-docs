# Star Forge: Reusable Components

**Star Forge** is a collection of user interface components that simplifies the development of accessible applications. Inspired by shadcn/ui, Star Forge offers a unique approach: instead of encapsulated libraries, you copy and paste pure code, maintaining full control over customization and integration. Built with **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI**, it combines design, accessibility, and flexibility for developers of all levels.

<Callout title="Why Star Forge?">
  Build interfaces quickly without sacrificing control. With Star Forge, you
  shape components to perfectly align with your design system, using clean,
  production-ready code.
</Callout>

## Functionalities?

- **Reusable**: Copy and paste directly into your project, with no unnecessary dependencies.
- **Customizable**: Adjust styles and behavior with Tailwind CSS or edit the TypeScript/React code directly.
- **Accessible**: Built with Radix UI, ensuring compliance with ARIA standards.
- **AI-ready**: Structured and readable code, ideal for integration with artificial intelligence tools.

Whether you’re a developer building a startup, a designer experimenting with layouts, or an agency seeking consistency, Star Forge is your ally in building user interfaces.
