## Set Up Next.js

### System Requirements

- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/) or later.

### Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js project using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets everything up automatically. To create a project, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest
```

During installation, you will see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After answering the prompts, [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Install Star Forge

### For Next.js Projects

<Steps>

<Step>
### Initialize the Project

Run the `init` command to set up Star Forge in a new or existing Next.js project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

<Callout className="mt-4">

You can use the `-d` flag to apply default settings, such as the `new-york` style, the `zinc` base color, and CSS variables support.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init -d
```

</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure components.json

You will be guided through a few questions to configure the `components.json` file:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

This file will be created in the root directory of your project and will define the style and theme preferences for Star Forge components.
</Step>

<Step>
### Add Components

Once configuration is complete, you can start adding components to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://star-forge-components.vercel.app/projects/r/text.json
```

The command above will add the `Text` component to the `components/star-forge` directory. You can import it like this:

```tsx title="index.tsx"
import { Text } from '@/components/star-forge/text';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Text.H1> Hello World </Text.H1>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Customize the Theme

Adjust the CSS variables in the `src/app/globals.css` file to align components with your design system:

```css title="globals.css"
:root {
  --background: 0 0% 100%;
  --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
  --radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Ready to Use

You are now ready to forge amazing interfaces with Star Forge! Explore the [components documentation](#) to add more elements and customize them as needed.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Additional Dependencies

Star Forge relies on the following libraries, which are installed automatically by the `npx shadcn@latest init` command:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and flexible component styling.
- **Radix UI**: To ensure accessibility and robust component behavior.
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)**: To efficiently manage style variants.

If you started the project with `create-next-app` and selected Tailwind CSS, it will already be configured. Otherwise, follow the [Tailwind CSS installation instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set it up manually.
